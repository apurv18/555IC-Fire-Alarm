# 555IC-Fire-Alarm

This system is built as part of Analog Electronics Course at Birla Institute of Technology and Science. It uses NE555 IC to detect and alert the user of a fire. 
Temperature threshold can be varied by using the potentiometer built into the system. 
On detection of a fire the system sounds a buzzer. 

The system was simulated using LTSpice. Fire stimulus was given as a varying resistance value, as real life implementation uses a thermistor (NTC). 

PCB design was completed in KiCAD IDE.
